<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "90" width = "90" style ="display: inline-block"/> 

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority. 
2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)
## Start in-session exercise and provide team-specific rationale for building capacity for participatory learning from simulation
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 - Team-specific rationale** __________________

### The purpose for this activity is to familiarize you with the model diagram and how causal diagrams can be useful to understanding why problems arise and persist. By the end, you should be able to easily navigate it and find detailed information about each variable.  This exercise has two parts, the first to practice navigating to your individual simulation world, and the second to use the diagram  to help you tell your Systems Story.  A Systems Story is a description of the causal connections that create the problem your team prioritized, _________________ .  


## Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to the Team world at **mtl.how/sim**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:15-00:20 - Team's Session 05 Question** __________________

### Let's explore the MTL Home Page.
+ To start this session, you should log in to your team world at **mtl.how/sim**, where you enter your username (email address) and password. After you click **LOGIN**, a pop-up box will appear with the text "Please select a World" on the blue bar. Select the world that starts with **"team" from the drop-down menu**.

+ Once you're on the _MTL_ Home Page, look over on the **left section with Session in the blue heading bar**.  

+ If you've gone into the ____ (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, or SP) Module before, you'll see the **name of the module and the dataset you chose under the first option**, Join Current Session. If so, select that and hit Play. If not, look **below and select the ____ (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, or SP) module**.  

+ "Select Team Data" will appear. Click on that and choose the team dataset from the drop-down menu. Then hit **Play**. (If you don't see any data to select in the Team Data menu, go back to the instructions in Session 4 to see how to upload your team dataset.)  

Now check what you're seeing against what we're showing on the screen. It should have your TEAM name at the **top left**, and YOUR name and photo at the **top right**, and YOUR team's dataset listed in the **blue bar of the main section above the model diagram, here**.  

Also, depending on the size of your monitor and whether your browser window is full-screen or less, you might see more or less than what we're showing of the model diagram. The model screen is a dynamic graphic, so the main model diagram will adjust if you re-size the browser window.
   +  On a PC, you can re-size your screen to get more or less of the diagram to show up at once by clicking the **stacked boxes icon in the far top right** of your computer screen. 
   +  On a MAC, to view the model in full screen click the **green button in the upper left of the browser** on your computer. To exit full screen, hover at the top of your computer screen, the toolbar will appear, click on "View", click on "Exit Full Screen."  
   
Navigate to experiment section to pull up the Question from last time.

# In-Session Exercise - Part 1
## Introducing the Simulation User Interface Main Section with the Model Diagram in relation to team's priority
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority**__________________ 

### Now we're ready to explore the simulation user interface main section with the model diagram in relation to your team. We'll ask a series of questions and your job is to find the answer.  
+ **Facilitators will ask team members to find certain information on the mtl.how/sim main section.**
+ **Find the answer and “chat” it back to the Facilitator by typing your answer into the chat box.**
+ **If at any time you are not sure how to find something, ask for help. The Facilitator will provide assistance by sending a hint or giving verbal support to all participants.**

**Question 1: Over what time frame does an experiment run?**  

Answer: You can find the time frame in the **Experiment Timeline** section up at the top of the model diagram section. Experiments simulate the plausible future out **two years from today**.  

**Question 2: Where do you find the descriptions for each variable in the module? Paste a portion of a description from one of the _Rates_ into the chat box?**

Answer: The **small circles with i inside throughout the sim UI** provide additional information when you click on them. There are 3 kinds of *i* variables in *Modeling to Learn*. First, there are explanations for the red variables that are read in from team data. Second, there are experimental variables - you can click on the *i* to understand what you are changing. Third, there explanations for the varables that are calculated by the model when you run a simulation. 

**Question 3: Describe in one sentence what happens in the diagram as you click to Reveal complexity**  

Answer: Options to Reveal Complexity are found under the *Experiment Timeline* in each module.  
   + You can select the check-boxes under *Reveal Complexity* to bring more of the model diagram into view, or uncheck the boxes to make it less visually complex.  
   + When we reveal the different *Reveal Complexity* options, additional colored boxes and light and dark blue arrows appear on the main model diagram.  As was just noted, you can play with clicking and unclicking the *Reveal Complexity* options [use mouse to show this] and study what appears on the screen.  
   + You should know that the amount of the model diagram being shown does NOT have anything to do with how the model itself is running when you run experiments - it's ONLY an option to let you control how much of the actual model's complexity you're viewing in the diagram.  
   
**Question 4: What is the significance of the variables in the red boxes?**

Answer: Red means read in from team data. 

# In-Session Exercise - Part 1
## Introducing stocks/flows and polarities among key variables related to the team's priority
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:30-00:40  - Team Priority**__________________

+ **Starting Point: Main model section with no additional complexities revealed.**

***Tip:* If you are not able to see the whole model diagram at once, try altering the size of the window using the browser's expand/reduce button and dragging the frame. The display will adjust to a stacked format that will get more of the diagram into one view.**  

+ **Imagine a veteran in care. Tell the systems story told by the diagram in real-life terms.  Make notes where you have questions or are unsure about the relationships depicted. Describe the connection between the model diagram and the team data table. How are they linked?**


+ Let's do a quick orientation to the model diagram.  
   + The navy blue circles or gauges are always a rate. The navy blue rectangles are patients or appointments. 
   
   + In telling a systems story, we want to trace the loop all the way around until we are back where we started - so that we close the feedback loop and fully understand why behaviors happen in our clinics.  
   
   + On the model diagram, you see plus and minus signs next to the blue lines. **Use Thumbs to demonstrate +/- concept**:  
         + If there is a plus sign between two variables, this means they move in the same direction (thumbs up - both up for increasing or both down for decreasing).  
         + If there is a minus sign, the two variables move in opposite directions (1 thumb up, 1 thumb down).  

## Cover complexity reveal (causal loop) and base case question and dynamic hypothesis related to the team's priority 
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 - Team Priority**__________________

  **CARE COORDINATION SYSTEMS STORY** - Wait Time Affects Referrals 
  
 + We'll reveal the "Wait Time Affects Referrals" detail in the Care Coordination or CC model diagram. Then, scroll down to the lower left of the model diagram to see what has been revealed.
      + Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  

 + The *Wait Time Affects Referrals* detail shows the connection between patient *Referral Rates*, patients *Waiting to Start* CC and *Target Wait Times* for patients. 
 
 + For this activity of telling a systems story, we are concerned patients are having to wait longer than we would like to start Care Coordination.  

 +  So, we'll start this systems story with the *Referral Rate* - the green box. As a clinician you know that when *Referral Rates* increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients *Waiting to Start* a service, in this case CC.  
 
      + As the patients *Waiting to Start* increases, the average *New Patient Wait Time* starts to climb. Note the plus sign from *Waiting to Start* to *New Patient Wait Time* which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients *Waiting to Start* decreases, the *New Patient Wait Time* will decrease also.  
   
      + Let's continue with the assumption that *New Patient Wait Time* is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the *Effect of Wait Time on Referrals* which decreases the *Referral Rate* so referrals to CC begin to slow down.  
   
      + Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don't have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first CC appointment.  

 + In addition to running experiments around our Target Wait Time, this loop shows that we can also experiment with team decisions about Referral Rate. 
      + We can ask questions like, "If the Referral Rate to CC goes up by some percentage because we've started graduating patients more quickly from other services - but our Starting Rate in CC stays the same because we don't have any extra appointment slots for new patients - what will become the 'new normal' for New Patient Wait Times in CC?"


**MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS STORY** 

 + We'll reveal the "Wait Time Affects Referrals" detail in the Medication Management or MM model diagram. Then, scroll down to the lower left of the model diagram to see what has been revealed.

      + Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  

    
 + The *Wait Time Affects Referrals* detail shows the connection between patient *Referral Rates*, patients *Waiting to Start* MM and *Target Wait Times* for patients. 

 +  We hear a lot of clinicians say that good, ethical treatment is if you start a patient on medication assistance, the patient should come in for a monthly evaluation. If a clinician isn't sure they can get a patient in for a monthly appointment, then they may decide not to start the patient on the service. For this activity of telling a systems story in the Med Management module, we would like to explore how our team can serve more patients with specific conditions, like Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), with our existing staffing levels.

 + We'll start this systems story with the *Referral Rate* - the green box. As a clinician you know that when *Referral Rates* increase, there is an increase in the back log of patients *Waiting to Start* a service, in this case MM.  

      + As the patients *Waiting to Start* increases, the average *New Patient Wait Time* starts to climb. Note the plus sign from *Waiting to Start* to *New Patient Wait Time* which indicates they will move in the same direction. So, if the patients *Waiting to Start* decreases, the *New Patient Wait Time* will decrease also.  
      + Let's continue with the assumption that *New Patient Wait Time* is increasing. As this wait time increases, it increases the *Effect of Wait Time on Referrals*. The *Effect of Wait Time on Referrals* is the difference between the *New Patient **Actual** Wait Time* and the team's desired or *Target Wait Time*.  
      + In the Med Management module, we can adjust target wait times for different diagnostic patients. The "stacked" red boxes labeled *Target Wait Time* indicates you can change the target wait time by adjusting the red sliders read in from your team data for patients with Alcohol Use Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder, Depression and Other conditions.  
      + The effect of an increasing wait time on referrals, which has a negative sign, means a decrease to the *Referral Rate* so referrals to MM begin to slow down.  
      + Patients may be kept in or referred to other services so that they don't have to wait longer than the desired or target wait time for their first MM appointment.   



**PSYCHOTHERAPY SYSTEMS STORY** - Balancing Existing and New Patients; Engagement After 3 Months 

 + The Psychotherapy or PSY module shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies.  

 + We'll reveal the "Balancing Patients" detail in the PSY model diagram.  
      + Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  
 
 +  For this activity of telling a systems story, we want patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start psychotherapy. So, if you as a clinician are totally full in your PSY slots, the only way you can start new patients is if patients quit or patients complete. Let's scroll down the model diagram to see what has been revealed in the blue shaded box titled *Patients in Their First 3 Months of Psychotherapy*.  
 
 + The *Reveal Complexity* detail for Balancing Patients shows the flow of patients and appointments in the PSY model. We see patients start psychotherapy and a certain number of patients get their first visit of PSY and end there; you can see this in the model here [use mouse to show "Patients in First Visit"]. We know that other patients will go on for additional visits. In the model diagram, we can explore data for patients who attend 2 to 7 visits [use mouse to show "Patients in Visit 2 to 7"] but they haven't yet completed a full course of PSY. Next, there is a subset of patients will go on to achieve 7 or more visits in their own first 3 months. Some will graduate and some will continue treatment after 3 months. Obviously our team wants patients to complete a full course of PSY without decreasing the new patients that can start.  
 
 + So, starting on the left side of the screen in the blue box. We can see that as the *Starting Rate* for PSY increases, it increases the Booking Rate. Remember, we follow the blue line upward to *Booking Rate* and there is a plus *+* sign which means the Starting Rate and Booking Rate move in the same direction. As the *Booking Rate* increases, this increases the appointments on the books for PSY [use mounse to show booking rate to appointments in PSY].  
  
 + As the overall appointment supply goes up it can increase the overall appointments for new patients or existing patients. So, as the *Appointments in Psychotherapy* increases, we follow the light blue arrow to *Appointments for Existing Patients* and see that plus *+* sign indicating an increase in appointments on the books for existing patients.  As the appointments for existing patients goes up, it decreases the appointments for new patients, as this goes down it decreases the *Starting rate* as shown with the long blue arrow down the left side of the screen that connects *Additional Appointments Available to New Patients* to *Starting Rate* with a plus *+* sign.  


**AGGREGATE MIX OF SERVICES SYSTEMS STORY** 

 + Because the Aggregate or AGG model includes a mix of services, the *Experiment Timeline* box has two options: *Reveal Complexity* and *Display Patient Services*. If you click through the services listed under *Display Patient Services* you will see the numbers change in the dark blue circles and rectangles in the model diagram. This represents the our team's appointments and patients data for each service. 
      + Remember, if you're not sure how a variable is defined, check the *i* descriptions on the model diagram or in the *Experiments* section.  

 + Let's show the "RVI and Wait Times" under *Reveal Complexity* in the AGG model.  
 
 + Our team is going to be losing two staff members in the near future. Since the aggregate module shows the interactions between all services offered by our team, we want to use this module to explore how we can best allocate appointments across services with reduced staffing levels. We also want to know what will happen to patient wait times if we change patient return-to-clinic visit intervals (RVI) and/or if the remaining staff members decide to work overtime or not.  

 + Let's walk through a systems story focused on the balancing loop titled "Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval right here on the model diagram [mouse over balancing loop on screen].  

 + Let's start In the Appointments section of the diagram with the *Booking Rate*. As the *Booking Rate* goes up, the *Appointments* increase. If there are more patients who need an appointment then there are appointments or clinical hours available, clinicians may feel work pressure. This is the light blue arrow with the plus *+* sign leading from *Appointments* to *Work Pressure*.  
 
      + When a clinic team experiences increasing *Work Pressure* then there is an *Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit INterval* such that as work pressure increases, there is an increases the time between appointments or the *Return to Clinic Visit Interval*.  
     
      + As the *Return to Visit Interval* increases the *Booking Rate* decreases, you can tell this by the negative sign at the end of the light blue arrow leading from RVI to Booking Rate. Thus, the balancing loop is *Appointment Backlog Extends Return Visit Interval* is complete.  

**MEASUREMENT-BASED STEPPED CARE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION SYSTEMS STORY** - Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery 

 + Starting with *Patient Load*, which is [CLICK ON I TEXT AND READ], one way that increasing patient load influences the team is the effect on care quality. If the team has fewer patients than they can effectively treat, then the effect on quality decreases, and the care quality delivered to patients increases.  
 
 + When *Care Quality* increases, the number of patients in the grey box labeled *Effect of MBC on Patient Symptoms and Risk* decreases, which then decreases *Patient Load*, further increasing *Care Quality*.  Let's zoom in to this part of the diagram to see how that works by clicking on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the grey box [CLICK ON MEASUREMENT BASED CARE VIEW]. 
 
 + Here we see some of our same variables, including *Care Quality*, which has the same causal relationships in this view as in the previous view.  When *Care Quality* goes up, two things happen:  
      + First, high-symptom patients improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to Improve” which affects the number of patients each week whose symptoms improve enough to be eligible to be stepped down to a less intense level of care), and  
      + Second, patients with high risk flags improve faster than before (see the arrow to “Time to UnFlag” which affects the rate at which patients with high risk flags have those flags removed).  

 + This causes more patients to flow into the “low symptom” group, so more patients can both end their care and be recommended to step down to a lower level of care. Now, click any one of the plus signs in a grey box to zoom out to the previous view [TOGGLE BACK TO STEPPED CARE VIEW].  
 
 + As more patients leave this setting, it further reduces the total number of patients in the GMH treatment setting, thus further decreasing the patient load and increasing quality. When moving this direction, this type of reinforcing loop is often called a “virtuous circle.”  However, this feedback loop also works in the opposite direction, where small increases in patients can lead to lower quality, more patients staying with “high symptoms,” resulting in even higher patient load. When this happens, this same loop is referred to as a “vicious circle,” or a “death spiral.” 

+ We have closed the loop, or brought our chain of causation full circle, and can now explain how this reinforcing loop of "Higher Care Quality Improves Recovery" could both energize our improvement efforts, or potentially derail them.
