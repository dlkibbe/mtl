## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table.
2. Test out your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">

### 1. Navigate to the data UI at mtl.how/data. 
This data is on the VA's secure SharePoint site, so it works best with *Internet Explorer*.

### 2. When you click the "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" button, it produces a table of descriptive team data.
  a. This is a different table from the one you generated last time by selecting the clinics that make up your team and then clicking "Get *Patient Level* Data." 
  b. Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*
  c. There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn*
   + Care Coordination (CC)
   + Medication Management (MM)
   + Psychotherapy (PSY)
   + Aggregate team services (AGG)
   + Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention (SP)

### 3. Select a module for review  
 a. Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are it's units?  
 b. Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?  
 c. Check out the last two columns. What is the difference between these two columns?  

### 4. Select a second module for review  
 a. Check out the last two columns.  
 b. Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are it's units?  
 c. Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?  

### 5. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?  
  a. If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.  

### 6. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?  
 a. If so, what is surprising?  
 b. Does the estimation definition (second to last columnn, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value?  

### 7. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?
  a. If so, what are you noticing?  
  b. In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?
